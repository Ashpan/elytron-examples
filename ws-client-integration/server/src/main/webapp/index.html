    	  This example demonstrates how WS client can make use of authentication configuration from Elytron client.

    	<p>
    	 There is no user interface for this quickstart. Instead, you can verify the
         Web Service is running and deployed correctly by accessing the following URL:
         </p>
         <div style="margin-left: 1em;">
         <a href="HelloService?wsdl">HelloService?wsdl</a>
         </div>
         <p>
          This URL will display the WSDL definition for the deployed Web Service endpoint.
